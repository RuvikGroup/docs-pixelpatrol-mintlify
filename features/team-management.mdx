## Team Switching

### Multi-Team Support

Users can belong to multiple teams:

```typescript
// Get user's teams
const teams = await getUserTeams(userId);

// Switch active team
await switchTeam(teamId);

// Team context in requests
const media = await getMedia({ 
  teamId: currentTeam.id 
});
```

### Team Context

All operations respect team context:
- Data isolation between teams
- Separate billing per team
- Independent settings
- Isolated moderation queues

## Team Creation

### Automatic Team Creation

Teams are created automatically when:
1. A new user signs up (they become the owner of their personal team)
2. Users are invited to join existing teams

### Initial Setup

After a team is created:
1. **First Site**: Create your initial site for moderation
2. **Invite Members**: Build your team by inviting collaborators
3. **Configure Rules**: Set up moderation policies for your content
4. **Subscription**: Choose a plan that fits your needs

  totalModerated: number;
  avgResponseTime: number;
  accuracyRate: number;
  memberActivity: {
    [memberId: string]: {
      itemsModerated: number;
      avgTime: number;
      accuracy: number;
    }
  };
}
```

### Audit Logs

## Billing & Subscriptions

### Team-Based Billing

Each team has independent billing:
- Separate subscriptions
- Usage tracking
- Invoice management
- Payment methods

### Usage Limits

Monitor team usage:
```typescript
const usage = await getTeamUsage(teamId);
// {
//   moderations: { used: 8500, limit: 10000 },
//   storage: { used: 2.5, limit: 10 }, // GB
//   members: { active: 5, limit: 10 }
// }
```

## Best Practices

### Team Organization

1. **Clear Naming**: Use descriptive team names
2. **Role Assignment**: Follow least privilege principle
3. **Regular Reviews**: Audit member access
4. **Documentation**: Document team processes

### Security

1. **Access Control**: Regular permission audits
2. **Invitation Management**: Monitor pending invites
3. **Activity Monitoring**: Track unusual behavior
4. **Data Separation**: Ensure team isolation

### Scalability
