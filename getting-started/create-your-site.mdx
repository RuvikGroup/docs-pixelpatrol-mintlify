# Creating Your First Site

Sites are the core of PixelPatrol - they represent the websites or applications you want to protect with content moderation. This guide will walk you through creating your first site.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

<CheckGroup>
  <Check>Logged into PixelPatrol</Check>
  <Check>Created or joined a team</Check>
  <Check>The URL of the website or application you want to moderate</Check>
</CheckGroup>

## Step 1: Navigate to Sites

1. From the dashboard, click **Sites** in the navigation menu
2. You'll see the Sites overview page
3. Click the **"Add New Site"** button

![Sites Overview Page](screenshots/sites-overview.png)

## Step 2: Basic Site Information

Fill in the basic details for your site:

<ParamField path="name" type="string" required>
  A friendly name for your site (e.g., "Main Website", "Mobile App")
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="url" type="string" required>
  The full URL of your site (e.g., `https://example.com`)
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="description" type="string">
  Optional description to help team members understand this site's purpose
</ParamField>

### Example Configuration

```json
{
  "name": "Community Forum",
  "url": "https://forum.example.com",
  "description": "Our main community discussion forum requiring active moderation"
}
```

<Note>
The URL is used for webhook callbacks and site identification. Make sure it's accessible from the internet if you plan to use webhooks.
</Note>

## Step 3: Configure Moderation Settings

### Select Moderation Type

Choose how content will be moderated for this site:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="AI Moderation">
    **Automated AI-Powered Moderation**
    
    Best for: High-volume content, real-time moderation needs
    
    - Content is automatically analyzed by AI
    - Instant moderation decisions
    - Configurable confidence thresholds
    
    <Info>
    AI moderation uses advanced models to detect inappropriate content, spam, and policy violations.
    </Info>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Rule-Based">
    **Custom Rule-Based Moderation**
    
    Best for: Specific policy requirements, keyword filtering
    
    - Define custom rules and patterns
    - Regex support for complex matching
    - Combine multiple conditions
    
    [Learn more about rules →](/features/rules)
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Hybrid">
    **Combined AI + Rules**
    
    Best for: Maximum accuracy and control
    
    - AI provides baseline moderation
    - Rules handle specific cases
    - Best of both approaches
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Set Confidence Threshold

If using AI moderation, configure the confidence threshold:

<Slider>
  <SliderTrack>
    <SliderRange />
  </SliderTrack>
  <SliderThumb />
</Slider>

- **Low (60-70%)**: More content flagged, fewer false negatives
- **Medium (70-85%)**: Balanced approach
- **High (85-95%)**: Only very confident violations flagged

<Tip>
Start with a medium threshold (75%) and adjust based on your moderation results.
</Tip>

## Step 4: Webhook Configuration (Optional)

Webhooks allow PixelPatrol to notify your application when moderation decisions are made.

### Enable Webhooks

<Steps>
  <Step title="Toggle Webhooks On">
    Click the webhook toggle to enable webhook notifications
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enter Webhook URL">
    Provide your endpoint URL that will receive moderation results
    
    ```
    https://api.example.com/webhooks/moderation
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Generate Webhook Secret">
    Click "Generate Secret" to create a secure webhook signing key
    
    <Warning>
    Save this secret immediately - it won't be shown again!
    </Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Webhook Payload Example

Your webhook endpoint will receive POST requests with this structure:

```json
{
  "event": "moderation.completed",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "data": {
    "media_id": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
    "status": "flagged",
    "confidence": 0.89,
    "categories": ["violence", "explicit"],
    "metadata": {
      "user_id": "user123",
      "context": "forum_post"
    }
  }
}
```

## Step 5: Rule Group Assignment (Optional)

If you have existing rule groups, you can assign them to your site:

1. In the "Rule Groups" section, click "Assign Rule Groups"
2. Select the rule groups you want to apply
3. Order them by priority (rules are evaluated top to bottom)

![Rule Group Assignment](screenshots/rule-group-assignment.png)

<Info>
Rule groups allow you to reuse moderation rules across multiple sites. You can create rule groups later if you don't have any yet.
</Info>

## Step 6: Review and Create

Before creating your site, review your configuration:

<Checklist>
  - [ ] Site name and URL are correct
  - [ ] Moderation type is appropriate for your content
  - [ ] Confidence threshold is set (if using AI)
  - [ ] Webhook URL is accessible (if enabled)
  - [ ] Webhook secret is saved securely
  - [ ] Rule groups are assigned (if applicable)
</Checklist>

Click **"Create Site"** to save your configuration.

## Step 7: Get Your API Key

After creating your site, you'll receive an API key:

1. Copy the API key shown in the success message
2. Store it securely in your application's environment variables
3. You can always retrieve it later from the site settings

```bash
# Example .env file
PIXELPATROL_API_KEY=pp_live_1234567890abcdef
PIXELPATROL_SITE_ID=site_abc123
```

## Testing Your Site

Now that your site is created, let's test the integration:

### Quick Test

1. Navigate to your site's detail page
2. Click "Test Moderation"
3. Upload a test image or enter test text
4. View the moderation results

### API Test

Test your integration with a simple API call:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.pixelpatrol.com/v1/moderate \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer pp_live_1234567890abcdef" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "content": "This is a test message",
    "type": "text",
    "metadata": {
      "user_id": "test_user"
    }
  }'
```

## Managing Your Site

After creation, you can:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="View Analytics" icon="chart-line">
    Monitor moderation statistics and trends
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Edit Settings" icon="gear">
    Update configuration, thresholds, and webhooks
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="View Logs" icon="scroll">
    Review webhook delivery logs and errors
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Manage Rules" icon="scale-balanced">
    Add or modify rule groups for this site
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Common Configuration Patterns

### E-commerce Site

```json
{
  "name": "Product Reviews",
  "moderation_type": "hybrid",
  "confidence_threshold": 0.80,
  "rule_groups": ["spam_detection", "competitor_mentions"]
}
```

### Social Platform

```json
{
  "name": "User Posts",
  "moderation_type": "ai",
  "confidence_threshold": 0.75,
  "webhook_enabled": true,
  "real_time": true
}
```

### Corporate Website

```json
{
  "name": "Contact Forms",
  "moderation_type": "rules",
  "rule_groups": ["profanity_filter", "spam_detection"]
}
```

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Webhook not receiving events">
    - Verify your webhook URL is publicly accessible
    - Check that SSL certificate is valid (HTTPS required)
    - Review webhook logs in the site detail page
    - Ensure your endpoint returns 200 OK status
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="API key not working">
    - Confirm you're using the correct API key
    - Check that the site is active
    - Verify your subscription has available moderations
    - Try regenerating the API key in settings
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Moderation results seem incorrect">
    - Adjust the confidence threshold
    - Review and update your rule groups
    - Check if content type matches configuration
    - Contact support with example content
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

<Tip>
**Site Organization Tips:**

1. **Use descriptive names**: "Mobile App - User Comments" instead of "App 1"
2. **Group by purpose**: Create separate sites for different content types
3. **Document webhook endpoints**: Keep track of which endpoints handle which sites
4. **Test thoroughly**: Always test moderation settings with real content samples
5. **Monitor regularly**: Check analytics to fine-tune your configuration
</Tip>
