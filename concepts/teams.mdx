## Overview

Teams are the foundational organizational unit in Pixel Patrol. Every user belongs to one or more teams, and all resources (sites, rules, media) are owned and managed at the team level.

## Key Concepts

### Team Structure

Each team has:
- **Team Owner**: Full administrative control
- **Team Members**: Collaborative access with role-based permissions
- **Team Settings**: Customizable configurations and subscription management

### Multi-Tenancy

Pixel Patrol implements team-based multi-tenancy:
- Complete data isolation between teams
- Row-Level Security (RLS) enforced at the database level
- Separate subscription and usage limits per team

</CardGroup>

## Creating a Team

Teams are created automatically when:
1. A new user signs up (becomes owner of their personal team)
2. An existing user creates an additional team
3. Through the team creation API

```typescript
// Example: Creating a team via Edge Function
const { data, error } = await supabase.functions.invoke('create-team', {
  body: { name: 'My New Team' }
})
```

## Team Switching

Users can belong to multiple teams and switch between them:
- Active team context is maintained in the application
- All actions are performed within the context of the selected team
- Team switcher UI component available in the navigation

## Best Practices

1. **Team Naming**: Use descriptive names that reflect the organization or project
2. **Member Management**: Regularly review and update team membership
3. **Role Assignment**: Follow the principle of least privilege
4. **Subscription Management**: Monitor usage to avoid hitting limits
