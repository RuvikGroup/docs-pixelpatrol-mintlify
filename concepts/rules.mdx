## Overview

Rules define content moderation criteria in PixelPatrol. Each rule evaluates specific aspects of submitted content, and rules work together within [Rule Groups](/concepts/rule-groups) to provide comprehensive content filtering.

**Important**: All rule management is done through the dashboard interface - no API access is available for creating, editing, or managing rules.

## How Rules Work

### Rule Group Logic

Within each rule group, **ALL rules must pass** for content to be approved. If any single rule fails, the content is flagged for moderation. This ensures comprehensive content filtering without compromise.

**Example**: A "Profile Photos" rule group with 3 rules:
- ✅ No explicit content (passes)
- ✅ Must have clear face (passes)  
- ❌ **No children in photos** (fails)
- **Result**: Content is rejected because one rule failed

### Rule Types

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Requirements" icon="circle-check">
    Content must satisfy this condition:
    - Must have clear face
    - Must be high quality
    - Must match profile
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Prohibitions" icon="ban">
    Content must avoid this condition:
    - No explicit content
    - No violence/weapons
    - No children
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Available Rule Templates

PixelPatrol provides 16 pre-built rule templates optimized for different moderation needs:

### Content Safety
- **Explicit Content** - Blocks NSFW/adult content
- **Violence/Weapons** - Prevents violent imagery
- **Drugs/Alcohol** - Filters substance-related content
- **Offensive Gestures/Symbols** - Blocks inappropriate symbols

### Image Quality
- **No Clear/Focused Face** - Ensures face visibility
- **Unclear/Blurry Image** - Maintains quality standards
- **Fake/Generated Image** - Detects AI-generated content
- **Screenshot Detected** - Prevents screenshot uploads

### Content Compliance
- **Contains Children** - Protects child safety
- **Multiple Focal Points** - Ensures single-person focus
- **Celebrity Detected** - Prevents celebrity photos
- **Excessive Text** - Limits text overlays

### Privacy & Identity
- **Consent/Privacy Violation** - Protects user privacy
- **Offensive Text/Images** - Blocks inappropriate overlays
- **Gender Mismatch** - Validates gender matches profile (requires advanced parameters)

### Custom Rules
Create completely custom rules for specific business requirements not covered by templates.

## Rule Configuration

Each rule can be configured with:

- **Name**: Descriptive identifier for the rule
- **Description**: Explanation of what the rule does
- **Evaluation Type**: Requirement or Prohibition
- **Confidence Threshold**: How confident AI must be (50%-100%)
- **Active Status**: Enable/disable without deleting
- **Advanced Parameters**: Additional metadata requirements

### Confidence Thresholds

Set how confident the AI must be in its evaluation:
- **High (85-95%)**: Fewer false positives, more false negatives
- **Medium (70-85%)**: Balanced approach (recommended starting point)
- **Low (50-70%)**: More false positives, fewer false negatives

## Advanced Parameters

Some rule templates support advanced parameters that use metadata from your media submissions for more precise moderation.

### Gender Matching Example

The "Gender Mismatch" rule requires gender information from media metadata:

<CodeGroup>
```json Advanced Parameters Schema
{
  "type": "object",
  "required": [
    "gender"
  ],
  "properties": {
    "gender": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "User's stated gender (e.g., male, female, non-binary)"
    }
  }
}
```

```json Media Submission
{
  "api_key": "site_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "content_url": "https://example.com/profile-photo.jpg",
  "app_media_id": "user-123-profile",
  "metadata": {
    "gender": "female",
    "user_id": "user-123"
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>

The AI validates that the photo matches the stated gender, helping ensure profile authenticity.

## Creating Rules via Dashboard

1. **Navigate to Rule Groups**: Sites → [Your Site] → Rule Groups
2. **Select Rule Group**: Choose the group to add rules to
3. **Click "Add Rule"**: Opens the rule creation dialog
4. **Select Template**: Choose from pre-built templates or "Custom"
5. **Configure Settings**:
   - Set evaluation type (requirement/prohibition)
   - Adjust confidence threshold
   - Add any advanced parameters
6. **Test & Save**: Use test interface to validate before saving

## Best Practices

### Rule Organization
- **Group by purpose**: Keep related rules together
- **Limit group size**: 3-7 rules per group for optimal performance
- **Name clearly**: Use descriptive names that explain the rule's purpose

### Threshold Tuning
- **Start at 85%**: Begin with higher confidence and adjust down if needed
- **Test with real content**: Use actual examples from your platform
- **Monitor false positives**: Review flagged content regularly
- **Adjust gradually**: Make small threshold changes (5-10%)

### Advanced Parameters
- **Validate availability**: Ensure your app provides required metadata
- **Handle missing data**: Consider fallback behavior
- **Privacy first**: Only collect necessary information
- **Document requirements**: Clearly communicate metadata needs

## Monitoring Performance

Track rule effectiveness through the dashboard:

- **Trigger Frequency**: Which rules activate most often
- **Confidence Distribution**: How confident AI is in decisions
- **False Positive Rate**: Rules that may need adjustment
- **Processing Time**: Rule evaluation performance

<Tip>
**Pro tip**: Review your moderation logs weekly to identify patterns and optimize rule configurations. Rules that trigger too frequently or rarely may need threshold adjustments.
</Tip>

## Limitations

- No composite rules with OR logic - all rules must pass
- No variables or dynamic values in rule configuration  
- No API access - all management through dashboard only
- Rules evaluate independently - no dependencies between rules
