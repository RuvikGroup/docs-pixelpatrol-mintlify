## Site Keys

Pixel Patrol uses site keys for API authentication. Each site you create has a unique site key that identifies your application and provides access to the API.

### Getting Your Site Key

1. Log in to your [Pixel Patrol dashboard](https://app.pixelpatrol.net)
2. Navigate to your team and select a site
3. Your site key will be displayed in the format: `site_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`

### Using Site Keys

Include your site key in the request body for all API calls:

```json
{
  "api_key": "site_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "content_url": "https://example.com/image.jpg",
  "app_media_id": "unique-123"
}
```

<Warning>
**Keep your site keys secure!** Never expose them in client-side code or public repositories. Always use them from your backend services.
</Warning>

## No Bearer Tokens Required

Unlike many APIs, Pixel Patrol doesn't use Authorization headers or Bearer tokens. Simply include your site key in the request body.

```bash
# ✅ Correct - site key in request body
curl -X POST https://api.pixelpatrol.net/functions/v1/submit-media \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "api_key": "site_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
    "body": "Text to moderate"
  }'

# ❌ Incorrect - don't use Authorization headers
curl -X POST https://api.pixelpatrol.net/functions/v1/submit-media \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer site_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" \
  -d '{"body": "Text to moderate"}'
```

## Team-Based Access

Each site key is tied to a specific team and site. The API automatically:

- Associates submitted media with the correct team
- Applies the site's configured rule groups
- Enforces the team's subscription limits
- Routes webhooks to the site's configured endpoints

## Key Rotation

If you suspect your site key has been compromised:

1. Contact [support@pixelpatrol.net](mailto:support@pixelpatrol.net) 
2. We'll generate a new site key for you
3. Update your applications with the new key
4. The old key will be immediately disabled
